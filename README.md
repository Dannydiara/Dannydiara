👋 Hey there, I'm Danny!

I'm a versatile web developer who loves turning ideas into sleek, user-friendly digital experiences. With over 3 years in the game, I’ve built everything from e-commerce platforms 🛒 and dynamic portfolio sites 📸 to interactive service websites 🌐 using React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.

What I’m about:

-Clean Code & Performance: I’m all about writing efficient, scalable code—think semantic HTML, code splitting, and lazy loading ⚡️.
-Modern Tooling: My go-to stack includes JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. I also dabble in mobile app development with React Native and Flutter 🛠️.
-Seamless Integrations: Whether it's integrating Stripe for secure payments 💳, leveraging RESTful APIs, or optimizing data fetching with GraphQL, I’m on it.
-Team & Collaboration: I thrive in agile environments and love working on projects that push the boundaries of what web experiences can be 🤝.

Always learning, always coding. Let’s build something awesome together! 🚀
